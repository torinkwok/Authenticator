## What's Authenticator?

Authenticator is a native and modern Mac app that generates one-time password (i.e. TOTP security tokens defined by [RFC 6238](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238)) that can be used with the two-factor verification of so many popular Internet services (such as Google, Evernote, GitHub, Amazon, Dropbox, Facebook, Linode etc.). You'd like to think of it as a modern Mac version of [Google Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8).

## Roadmap

- iCloud and Dropbox sync
- Notification Center widget for fast picking up passwords
- Scan QR codes that include accounts with Mac camera
- Supports counter-based (i.e. HOTP security tokens) passwords for special usage

## The app:

- does not collect information about your system
- won’t ask you to allow access to your any unneccesary sensitive data
- doesn’t have to connect to the internet to do its work
- won't upload your accounts to someone else
- will never steal your wife and enslave your children

Amazing huh? It’s thanks to the mathematics and my sense of morality to make all of “don’t, won’t and never" above possible. Happy authenticating!
